# Issue #2: Escaping Browser Tabs Without Losing Our Souls

Welcome to the PWA Gazette, your semi-regular-ish email newsletter devoted to Progressive Web App news and updates. Feel free to forward this to friends, who can [subscribe on the website](http://pwagazette.com/) for future updates.

## Context
Are you still trying to figure out what this whole PWA thing is about? Here's some seminal reading to get up to speed:

### [Progressive Web Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/)
In the blog post that started the whole PWA movement, [Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate) defines the nine attributes that make a web app a *progressive web app*.

### [What, Exactly, Makes Something A Progressive Web App?](https://infrequently.org/2016/09/what-exactly-makes-something-a-progressive-web-app/)
Another post from Alex Russell, this time with more details on what makes for a *good* progressive web app.

### [Progressive Web Apps Simply Make Sense](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/progressive-web-apps-simply-make-sense/)
PWA's are "a no-brainer for most businesses", and [Jason Grigsby](https://twitter.com/grigs) lays out six simple reasons why.

### [You Might Not Need Electron](https://youmightnotneedelectron.com/)
A review of the native-like capabilities built into modern browsers, and appeal to developers that they might not need to use [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to build their next project.

### [PWA Stats](https://www.pwastats.com/)
A community-driven list of stats and case studies that demonstrate the impact of PWA's on the businesses that have adopted them. It's a very handy resource if you're trying to convince decision makers on the viability of PWA's.

## Tutorials
Now that you've got the context, here's the must read & watch tutorials to get a handle on the basics of PWAs:

### [The Service Worker Lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/service-worker/lifecycle)
If there's anything tricky about Service Workers, it's their installation, activation and update life cycle - which this article explains in full detail.

### [The Offline Cookbook](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/)
This excellent resource, also from [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake), quickly shows how to implement over a dozen common Service Worker installation and resource caching patterns.

### [There is a Proxy* in Your Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etACK2qbHfc)
The always phenomenal [Ilya Grigorik](https://twitter.com/igrigorik) presents a Service Worker 101 and caching strategy session at Velocity conference.

### [Streaming Service Workers: Live Code Session - Supercharged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tr-scf7trE)
In this Supercharged Live Code Session, [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) and [Das Surma](https://twitter.com/dassurma) implement a streaming Service Worker, coding in real time, bugs and all!
